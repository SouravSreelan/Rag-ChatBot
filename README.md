# 📄 RAG Chatbot with PDF Upload in Google Colab

This project is a simple **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot built in **Google Colab** that lets you upload a PDF file, extract its content, and ask questions about it. It uses Google's **Gemini** models for embeddings and content generation.

## ✨ Features  

- 📄 **PDF Upload**: Easily upload a PDF directly in Colab.
- 🧠 **Embedding with Gemini**: Each chunk of the document is vectorized using Google’s `embedding-001` model. 
- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Retrieve the most relevant chunks using FAISS.
- 💬 **Ask Anything**: Ask questions, and get context-aware answers generated by Gemini’s `gemini-1.5-flash` model.

## 🧑‍💻 How it Works

1. **Upload PDF**  
   Use Google Colab’s `files.upload()` to upload any PDF file.  

2. **Text Extraction**  
   The entire PDF is read and converted into raw text using `pypdf`.  

3. **Chunking**   
   The text is split into manageable chunks (default 500 characters) to enable effective retrieval.

4. **Embeddings Generation**  
   Each chunk is converted into an embedding using Gemini’s embedding model.

5. **Indexing with FAISS**  
   All embeddings are indexed using **FAISS** for fast nearest-neighbor search.

6. **Retrieval + Generation**  
   - When you ask a question, the bot finds the top 3 most relevant chunks.
   - It then passes these chunks as context to Gemini’s `gemini-1.5-flash` to generate an accurate answer.
